## Technical Question

You can answer this question in any language you like, as long as you specify what language it
"is. Code does not necessarily have to compile, or run. Depending on the language you use, thesolution may be really simple or really complex, so keep in mind that we are looking for how you approach the problem, which edge cases you have considered, and any documentation that helps the readability of your code.
You can paste your code inline, or link us to a github (or similar) repository containing your solution. Again, this entire assessment shouldnâ€™t take too long, so pseudo code is okay as long as you are communicating what you are trying to do.

* Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array
of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] becomes [1,2,3,4].

## Language Used

I used Ruby syntax for the solution / Rspec for testing

## Running the tests:
```rake```


## Edge Cases

* Argument passed is not an array
* Array contains non-array objects or non-integers
